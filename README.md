# KinderJoy-of-Creation
A little big project
 1. Simulating a realistic conversation using a fixed number of threads with full NLP support + neural network for each thread. each thread will have access to everything some other thread writes and will tag all the questions and reply to them based on a personality quotient unique to each thread. We shall use an initiator and use this to see which thread gets ignored and which thread is more likeable after the conversation terminates. Idea is to use these threads to simulate realistic conversations for fun.
